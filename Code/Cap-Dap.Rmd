Setting things up:
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)
```

Importing the data:
```{r}
DF <- read.csv(here("Data", "biostats_copepod_data.csv"), stringsAsFactors = T)
View(DF)
```

Looking at the data for luminosity:
```{r}
ggplot(DF, aes(x = before_after, y = L)) +
geom_boxplot() +
xlab("Treatment") +
ylab("Luminosity") +
theme_bw() +
facet_wrap(~treatment)+
scale_x_discrete(limits = c("before", "after"))
```
```{r}
t.test(L ~ before_after, data = DF)
# this does not separate the different light treatments, but shows that for both natural light and darkness treatments, the pigmentation of the copepods fades during a 7-day period
```
